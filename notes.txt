Todo:

- fancier display (dots w blur and stuff idk)
- do more sounds (based on length of sound register)
X do something about the casting
X refactor all the chip8 stuff
    X single parameter per function call (cleaned function calls)

fixed situation where frame_counter could overflow:
    changed to u8 that does a wrapping add

fixed speed_multiplier underflowing when decreasing the game speed below zero
    Hitting KeyCode::Key8 now does a saturating_sub(1) so value never goes below zero

speed_multiplier is now capped at x10

move audio files into their own directory (removed tick.mp3 since it is not used)

-there is still something wrong with keypad_test rom
-we should maybe make a custom rom that displays CHIPPI in rainbow mode
